# ZombieFarmerRemastered

in 2015 I've created a console game called ZombieFarmer as a project for IT academy I've studied at. It was impressive at the time as I bearly had any tools in my disposal, we haven't learned many patterns and I was not aware of best practisies. I still have a lot to learn but I've desided to revisit this project and improve upon it. 
My goals for this project are:
* Add some graffics
* Remake some of the classes using appropriate design putterns and STL
* Learn something in the process
